# Python/Terraform interop example

* Terraform can take templates as JSON, no need to spit out HCL - <https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax-json.html>
* Terraform has to be used via CLI for the time being - <https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12582>

```sh
docker-compose up
```
